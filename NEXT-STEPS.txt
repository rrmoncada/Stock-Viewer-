as of 2/8/2023

the program connect to the AlphVantage free api to look up stock data 
we also use the plotly library to organize the stock data in a nice chart

next steps:
add some part to view the stocks symbol
add the ability to view up to 5 index funds
add a tool to keep track of the top 5 performing index funds
add a new page that lets you look up any index fund
